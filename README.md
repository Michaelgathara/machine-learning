## Table of Contents

[Reference Notebooks](https://github.com/Michaelgathara/machine-learning/tree/main/reference-notebooks)
<br>
Reference Notebooks are Data Science/Machine Learning Juypter Noteboooks I was provided during my internship with the University of Alabama Department of Physics and The Economic Development Partnership of Alabama. They cover some basics such as data cleaning and Pandas, as well as intermediate topics such as model validation.  
<br>
[Regression Algorithms](https://github.com/Michaelgathara/simple-ml/tree/main/regression)
<br>
1. [Linear Regression](https://github.com/Michaelgathara/simple-ml/blob/main/regression/linear_regression.ipynb)
	<br>
	1a.  **Dataset**: [Tesla Stock Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/timoboz/tesla-stock-data-from-2010-to-2020?resource=download)
	<br>
	1b. **Attempt**: Predicting daily highs 
	<br>
	1c. **Result**: Model Score: $$R^2 = 0.999803851997443$$
	<br>
	1d. **Usefulness**: Little to no usefulness due to the enigmatic nature of the stock market
