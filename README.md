## Other works
- You can find some group projects I did with friends under the Github Organization [Computer Talkers](https://github.com/Computer-Talkers)
- I wrote a Neural Network from scratch for both GPUs and CPUs [here](https://github.com/Michaelgathara/GPU)
- Notebooks my team at the Economic Development Partnership of Alabama used to analyze where students were going post-grad from Alabama colleges [here](https://github.com/MCDC-Team-4/retain-alabama)
## Table of Contents

[Reference Notebooks](https://github.com/Michaelgathara/machine-learning/tree/main/reference-notebooks)
<br>
Reference Notebooks are Data Science/Machine Learning Juypter Noteboooks I was provided during my internship with the [University of Alabama Department of Physics](https://www.uab.edu/cas/physics/) and [The Economic Development Partnership of Alabama](https://edpa.org/). They cover some basics such as data cleaning and Pandas, as well as intermediate topics such as model validation.

	1a.  **Dataset**: [Tesla Stock Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/timoboz/tesla-stock-data-from-2010-to-2020?resource=download)
	<br>
	1b. **Attempt**: Predicting daily highs 
	<br>
	1c. **Result**: Model Score: $$R^2 = 0.999803851997443$$ -Highly inflated, may be overfitted here
	<br>
	1d. **Usefulness**: Little to no usefulness due to the enigmatic nature of the stock market
